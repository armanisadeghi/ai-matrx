-- dd226_scheduler_publishes_nothing_to_a_signed_out_reader
-- (DD-226. db-rules §0/§6d/§9. GRANTS ONLY — no DDL, no policy, no row touched.)
--
-- THE DOCTRINE THIS FILE APPLIES (DD-222, B-113): the bound of a signed-out surface is the set of
-- columns that surface renders. Where the four-repository census finds NO signed-out surface, the
-- bound is the EMPTY list — a declared "no signed-out reader exists" and a live `anon` column grant
-- cannot both be true, and the grant is the half that is wrong.
--
-- Every relation below carries, in `ANON_COLUMN_SURFACE` (lib/security/public-exposure.ts), the
-- DD-186 reason "No signed-out reader was found for it in the four-repository census — the bound is
-- what keeps a column added tomorrow from publishing itself". DD-186 wrote that sentence and then
-- left the columns granted. This file makes the grant agree with the sentence.
--
-- ═══ THE CENSUS, RE-RUN BY THIS LANE ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-- matrx-frontend: every `.from("<table>")` / `.schema(...).from(...)` call site was enumerated and
--   each was checked against the set of code a signed-out visitor can actually execute — the files
--   under `app/(public)/**` (which are the only routes that name a table for an anonymous URL), and
--   the eight call sites of `getScriptSupabaseClient()`, which builds a client on the PUBLISHABLE
--   key and therefore runs as `anon` wherever it is called from. No relation below appears in
--   either set.
-- matrx-extend / matrx-local: no reader of any relation below.
-- aidream: reads this database as the service role or through matrx-orm; its one publishable-key
--   client always carries the caller's JWT.
-- `utils/permissions/publicLane.ts` (`PUBLIC_LANE_COLUMNS`) — the register that decides which types
--   get an indexable signed-out page at all — names `note`, `message_template` and `fc_set`. No type
--   below is in it, so `/p/e/<type>/<id>` does not exist for any of them and `publicLaneSelect()`
--   throws rather than inventing one.
--
-- ═══ RED, MEASURED AGAINST THE LIVE DATABASE, EVERY PROBE ROLLED BACK ═════════════════════════
--   scheduler.sch_task — Latent (the grant is open; no row is on the public side of the gate today). RED, one row flipped to visibility='public' inside a rolled-back transaction and read AS ANON: {"id":"a7c1e2d3-0000-4e5f-9a00-0000000000f1","kind":"tool","title":"HR Time & Attendance recompute (dispatch-on-demand)","description":"Consumer for hr._recompute_enqueue. hr.punch_record / punch_correct / attendance_exception_resolve enqueue one sch_run per a…
--
-- The relations whose row gate currently yields nothing to `anon` are latent exactly as
-- `agent.exemplar` was before DD-222: the grant is open and the data has simply not arrived on the
-- public side of the gate yet. Latency is an accident of data, never a decision.
--
-- Signed-in readers are untouched: the count of columns `authenticated` may SELECT is captured
-- before and asserted identical after, per relation. Columns are revoked BY NAME — a table-level REVOKE does not remove column grants (B-78
-- measured that on `docproc.processed_documents`) — and the loop takes the names from the catalog,
-- so it cannot miss one the way a hand-typed list can. It RAISES if a single column survives.
--
-- This file changes no row and no policy: `pub_read` is the generated DD-173 base contract and only
-- `iam.apply_rls` may write a policy (§6d).
