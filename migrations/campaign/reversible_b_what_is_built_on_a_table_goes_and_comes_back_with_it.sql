-- HANDOFF T2.1: "Restore (or Undo) brings it back with its forms and dashboards." Measured on the
-- clone 2026-10-02: archiving Cedar Ridge Physical Therapy's "Home Exercise Plans" took its 20
-- records, its columns, its pick list and its rule — and left its form ("Weekly exercise
-- check-in", custom.anon_form), its dashboard ("Plans by status") and its saved view ("Active
-- plans", platform.saved_view) live: a form still taking answers into an archived table. Undo
-- (custom.record_restore on the table) could not bring them back because they never went.
--
-- WHAT IS BUILT ON A TABLE (census, 2026-10-02)
--   already in the archive (custom.table_contents): records · saved views kept as records ·
--     rules scoped to it (notifications, digests, quarantine) · fields · its own pick lists
--   added here, as store records through custom.record_delete (they join the event's `took`):
--     dashboards (data_class dashboard, data.subject_table_id) · checklist templates and runs
--     (data_class checklist_template / checklist_run, data.about_table_id)
--   added here, named in the event's `built_on` with the moment they went:
--     forms and booking pages (custom.anon_form.table_id — a booking page is a form) ·
--     inbound addresses (custom.anon_inbound.table_id) · saved views (platform.saved_view.subject_id) ·
--     portals whose client table it is (custom.portal.client_table_id, archived_at)
--   left as they are: submissions, imports, outbox and comments (history of what happened, not
--     things built on it) · inbox approvals (withdrawn on archive by their own trigger) · a portal
--     that only shows this table among others (custom.portal_table — the portal still serves the rest)
--
-- custom.table_archive keeps its chunking exactly as it was: only its last call (the one that
-- archives the Table itself) takes the built-on rows. custom.record_restore brings back each
-- `built_on` row only when it still carries this archive's moment. No grant, table or index changes.
