-- RELATION-TARGETS — A RELATION THE WALL LETS THROUGH CAN HOLD ITS VALUE.
--
-- WHAT WAS WRONG. `guardswitch_green.sql` failed on the dev clone at PART 2's COMMIT with
--   23514  a relation's ASSOCIATION landed with no value beside it
-- from the deferred halves guard `custom._relation_halves_agree`. Adjudicated (2026-09-23):
-- the guard is right and the SUITE was wrong — it wrote the association half alone, directly
-- into `platform.associations`, the way every writer did before the corrected REL-11 made the
-- two halves one fact. But fixing the suite to write the link the way a person does, through
-- `platform.relation_set`, found the STORE half of the defect:
--   23514  supplier points at something that is not there
-- from `custom.validate_values`. Its relation arm demanded a live record of THIS organization
-- in the field's `relation_target` table, and read nothing else of the declaration. So:
--   · a relation whose target_mode is `any` or `several` (REL-8) could hold only records of
--     its first-named table, although `platform.enforce_relation_edge` lets its edge through;
--   · a relation into another organization — which REC-29 / VIS-34 open only when the table
--     allows it AND both organizations have turned links on — could never hold its value.
-- Since the halves guard (rightly) refuses an edge with no value, both were impossible to
-- write at all: the cross-organization link, the whole subject of guardswitch PART 2, was a
-- feature the store could no longer produce by any door.
--
-- THE FIX. One predicate, `custom.relation_value_target_ok`, asks of the VALUE what
-- `platform.enforce_relation_edge` asks of the EDGE: a live target record; its table is one
-- the declaration names (or the mode is `any`); and if it belongs to another organization, the
-- Table the relation starts at allows it and `custom.cross_organization_links_open` says both
-- organizations do. The fast path — a live record of this organization in the declared table
-- — is answered first and is exactly the old condition, so no value the store accepted before
-- is refused now. A closed wall answers exactly as a missing record does, so the refusal says
-- nothing about another organization's rows.
