-- DATA-V2-BASICS-2 (2026-09-29) — AN ARCHIVE UNDER WAY SAYS SO. BREAKER-1 B-F13: archiving a table of more
-- than 50 records takes several passes (each pass is one transaction under the ~8 s gateway limit), and a
-- reload in the middle showed a fresh "Archive this table" button with no word that half the records were
-- already put away. custom.table_archive now answers "in_progress" — an open archive event of this table,
-- not yet done — on every call, the chunk-0 look included, so the page offers "Carry on archiving".
-- Replaces one body; same signature, same answers plus one key.
