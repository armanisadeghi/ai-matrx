-- chair-step: this REPLACES two bodies, same signatures, same SECURITY, same search_path, same grants (CREATE OR REPLACE keeps them): custom.confidential_answer(uuid, uuid, permission_level) (STABLE SECURITY DEFINER; the one Confidential answer, asked by iam.has_access_for_base and custom.reaches_directly) and custom._table_shape_guard() (the trigger body on custom.record). One thing changes: a Confidential Table's `readers` entry may carry `when`, a condition on the row in the saved-view where grammar (a flat {column: value} map, or a Rule expression) - the reader field names its reader only while the condition is true of the row - and the guard refuses a `when` that is not an object or a flat key that is not a column of the table. Entries without `when` answer exactly as before. The Arman-approved door is untouched: readers (with or without when) are still set only through custom.set_table_confidential_arman_explicitly_approved. No table, column, index, policy, grant or data row is touched.

-- A READER FIELD APPLIES WHEN A RULE IS TRUE.
--
-- THE GAP (lane 12, HR proof two, gap 3). The employee must read her review once the manager shares it
-- (status = shared), and not a minute before - and nothing could automate that: a workflow acts as its
-- owner, who may not write the other person's row, and a reader field applied from the moment it was
-- filled. Lane 12 asked for "readers apply when a Rule is true". This is that, in the one place the
-- reads already decide: custom.confidential_answer.
--
-- THE RULE. `readers: [{field, level, when}]`. `when` is written in the grammar every saved view's
-- where and custom.read_records_page's filter already use - never a second grammar:
--     {"status": "shared"}                                                    a flat map: column = value (and)
--     {"op": "eq", "args": [{"field": "<field id>"}, {"const": "shared"}]}    a Rule expression
-- It is the TABLE's rule about the ROW: worked out over the row's own stored values, every column, no
-- reader seat (the reader may not read `status` herself - the rule may). Compiled by the store's own
-- compilers (custom.record_filter_sql(jsonb) for a flat map, custom.rule_filter_node_sql +
-- custom.rule_truth for a Rule) and asked of exactly this row, inside the same answer the platform's one
-- check (iam.has_access_for_base) and the store's ladder (custom.reaches_directly) already ask - so a
-- list, a read by id, an aggregate, an export and REST all turn at the same moment. A `when` that is not
-- true, or that cannot be worked out, leaves that reader entry closed; the owner, the Table's owner (unless
-- maker_is_reader) and a share are unchanged. Before it is true the row is a header to her (CHAIR-ACCESS b).
