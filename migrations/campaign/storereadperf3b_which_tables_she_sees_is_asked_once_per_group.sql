-- chair-step: it CREATES two server-only helper functions (custom.tables_seen_once_per_group, custom._seen_one: SECURITY DEFINER, no client EXECUTE, server_only door rows) and REPLACES the bodies of custom.visible_set, custom.hub_changed_by, custom.data_home_tables, custom.data_home_items and custom.data_home_changed_by. Same signatures, same grants, same door rows for the five; no table, policy or user/business data row is touched, and two platform.client_callable_door registry rows are inserted. Nothing a person sees changes: the one ladder's own viewer answer about each Table is asked once per group of Tables it cannot tell apart instead of once per Table, and the data home's doors ask it once for all of a person's organizations.

-- STORE-READ-PERF-3 — WHICH TABLES SHE SEES IS ASKED ONCE PER GROUP, FOR EVERY ORGANIZATION AT ONCE.
--
-- THE PROBLEM (measured on the dev clone, 2026-09-28/29, warm, server side): the data home asks
-- what a person can see across ALL her organizations (Arman's default). Each of its doors called
-- custom.query_visible_ids(org, Table kernel) once per organization, and custom.visible_set's
-- Table-kernel branch asked custom.has_visibility once per Table: admin@admin.com 481 ladder walks
-- (0.55 ms each), test@test.com 472 — the 97 in her two organizations that share only what is
-- shared cost 9 ms each (every arm walked to prove "no", then arm 4). data_home_tables 457 / 1,402
-- ms, data_home_items 472 / 1,474, who-changed-it 448 / 628 (admin / member).
--
-- THE FIX:
--   1. custom.tables_seen_once_per_group(person, organizations) — the ladder's viewer answer about
--      every live Table of those organizations, custom.reaches_directly asked once per signature of
--      look-alike Tables and arm 4 asked only where it could say yes (its header carries the whole
--      argument and every stop). It leaves each organization's answer in the STATEMENT memo.
--   2. custom.visible_set's Table-kernel branch reads that memo when the door statement that called
--      it already asked, and otherwise asks the helper for its one organization (viewer only; any
--      other level walks every Table as before). Its grant ceiling reads the same memo.
--   3. data_home_tables / data_home_items / data_home_changed_by ask the helper ONCE for all the
--      person's organizations before their per-organization walks; hub_changed_by answers its
--      Tables from custom.visible_set's kernel answer instead of one ladder walk per id;
--      data_home_items answers portals from the helper and checklist templates through
--      custom.levels_of.
--
-- WHY THE HELPERS NEVER NAME THE ROW LEVEL COLUMN: access ladder T-13 retires it and refuses any
-- new function body that names it (platform._t13_no_new_row_column_reader). The helpers read a
-- row's columns as a whole (its jsonb minus id, content and clocks) — a superset of what the ladder
-- reads, whatever the columns are called, so they keep working unchanged when T-13 drops the
-- column — and ask the ladder only through custom.reaches_directly and custom.levels_of. The five
-- replaced bodies are already on T-13's reader list, unchanged in identity.
--
-- Guard: matrx-frontend/scripts/campaign-tests/storereadperf3b_green.sql (identical answers for both
-- seats in every organization, the helper = the ladder for every member of every organization, the
-- timing clause, plants).
-- Inverse: migrations/inverse/storereadperf3b_which_tables_she_sees_is_asked_once_per_group_down.sql

-- STORE-READ-PERF-3 (2026-09-28). WHICH TABLES THIS PERSON SEES IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS: the one
-- ladder's own viewer answer about every live row of the Table kernel, asked once per group of
-- Tables it cannot tell apart instead of once per Table.
--
-- `seen` is exactly what custom.visible_set's Table-kernel loop answered about each live Table at
-- viewer, one ladder walk per Table (0.55 ms for a Table she owns, 9 ms for one in an organization
-- that shares only what is shared, and the data home asks it for every organization she is in). On
-- a Table that answer is custom.reaches_directly (arms 1 to 3b and the scope arm) OR arm 4
-- (custom.table_has_a_visible_record: something inside it opens to her). The two halves:
--
-- 1. custom.reaches_directly ONCE PER SIGNATURE. What that walk reads about one record is (i) its
--    own columns; (ii) rows that NAME it by id: a grant (iam.permissions), a membership held on it
--    (record or scope), a library grant (platform.entity_grants), a closure row
--    (platform.reachability), a scope assignment or a portal relation (platform.associations), an
--    owned relation record (arm 3b, found from data->parent_id); (iii) its carrying edges
--    (custom.carrying_edges_of), recursing into each container through the same three. So a Table
--    named by nothing in (ii), whose id no second row carries, whose parent_id is well formed, and
--    whose ONE container is a record named by nothing, carried by one row and carried by nothing
--    itself, answers exactly like every other such Table whose own columns and whose container's
--    columns are the same. The signature is those columns: the whole row but its id, content and
--    clocks, a superset of what the ladder reads, so it can only split a group, never merge two
--    that differ. It is custom.levels_of's argument (STORE-READ-PERF-2) taken one carrying edge up
--    to a leaf container. One container only: custom.addressed_cap_specific takes the first
--    container at the nearest depth, and two at one depth come out in an order their ids decide.
--    Every other Table is asked on its own, through custom.levels_of (the same viewer answer).
--    EVERY Table is asked on its own when the registry gives `record` a per-row input no signature
--    carries: an FK containment parent, a reference gate, a detail or child parent pointer, a row
--    class column, the detail variant, owner-only trash.
-- 2. ARM 4, in its own terms and only where it could say yes: she created a live record in the
--    Table; else the viewer answer about each id custom.read_door_granted_ids names (when no more
--    than the ceiling) and about each record something other than the Table carries
--    (custom.carrying_edges_in, once per organization); more carried candidates than the ceiling,
--    where custom.table_has_a_visible_record's own LIMIT picks, are answered by it.
--
-- THE MEMO. Group answers live in this call's loop. As it returns it also leaves each
-- organization's answer in the STATEMENT memo (platform.memo_k_put: fenced by the statement, the
-- backend, the transaction's first write and the seat), so the per-organization custom.visible_set
-- calls the same door statement makes next read it instead of walking again. Nothing is stored
-- anywhere else, and nothing outlives the statement.
