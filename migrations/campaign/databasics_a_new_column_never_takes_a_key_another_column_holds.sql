--
-- What a person met (Arman, his own table, 2026-09-27): the column "Resets" (key `resets`) had been
-- renamed "Account Type". "Add column" → "Resets" was refused *This table already has a field called
-- "Resets"* — no column on screen has that name. Two more doors of the same class:
--   · a new column of the SAME kind as the old holder was answered with the old column's id, so the
--     person's column "records internally but never shows" (the idempotent same-type rule);
--   · a key a RETIRED column held is still under every record's value history, so a new column
--     given it would show the old column's values.
-- Now: a key the caller did not ask for is the store's to choose, and it picks one no column of the
-- table has ever held (`resets_2` …) unless the holder is the same column said again (same name).
-- A clash on a key the caller asked for is refused naming the column that holds it.

  -- type, no rules, no validation and no way to ever get one. The old suites never saw it
