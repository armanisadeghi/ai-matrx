-- VIS-2 (4 of 4) — THE FIELD-TYPE CONVERSION WRITES ITS OWN MIGRATION ROW.
--
-- MEASURED LIVE, 2026-09-19, on the main database, on the body lane DOOR-FIX landed at
-- 13:42:52Z. `custom.migrate_retype` records a `history.migration_log` row and THEN patches
-- the Field; `custom._field_type_converts_values` - the AFTER UPDATE trigger on the Field row
-- that does the actual rewriting - records nothing. Both routes end in the same rewrite:
-- every value of the table converted where it converts and moved into `_retired` with its
-- reason where it does not. Only one of them leaves a trace.
--
-- So a person who retypes a Field through the ordinary write door (which is what a screen,
-- an import, an agent and `custom.record_update` all do) rewrites their whole table and the
-- Migrations log does not know it happened - which means HIS-8's undo does not exist for it.
-- That is a silent change to customers' values, and nothing in this system fails silently.
--
-- THE ROW IS WRITTEN WHERE THE REWRITE IS. Same transaction by construction: it is a trigger.
-- Its inverse is the Field's previous `type` and `config` as a patch - byte-identical in shape
-- to the inverse `custom.migrate_retype` already stores - so undoing it re-fires this same
-- trigger and converts the values back. Recorded ONCE: when `migrate_retype` is the caller its
-- row is already in this transaction, and `applied_at >= now()` (the transaction timestamp) is
-- what says so.
--
-- ADDITIVE: one `create or replace` on a trigger function. Checked before it was written that
-- lane DOOR-FIX had not already done it on origin/main - it had not, and the live body proves
-- it.

  -- the Field, but the CONVERSION is this trigger's, and this trigger is what runs when the
  -- same Field is retyped through the ordinary write door. So a type change made the normal
  -- way rewrote every value of the table, moved what would not convert into `_retired`, and
  -- left NOTHING in the migration log: HIS-8's undo did not exist for it and the Migrations
  -- screen did not know it had happened. The row is written here, where the rewrite is, so
  -- both routes leave the same trace.
  --
  -- The inverse is the Field's own previous shape, which is a `patch` on the Field record -
  -- the identical inverse `custom.migrate_retype` stores, and `custom.record_update` on the
  -- Field is what puts it back, firing this trigger again to convert the values the other way.
  --
  -- ONE ROW, NOT TWO. When `custom.migrate_retype` is the caller it has already recorded its
  -- row a few statements earlier IN THIS TRANSACTION, and `now()` is the transaction
  -- timestamp, so `applied_at >= now()` is exactly "recorded by this transaction" - it cannot
  -- match an older row and there are no newer ones.
