-- LIMITS-FIX — THE ONE ANSWER COULD NOT BE BUILT, BECAUSE `||` IS TWO OPERATORS.
--
-- `limitsfix_a_table_s_declared_fields_exist.sql` collected each problem with
--   v_bad_hints := v_bad_hints || ('REC-1: heavy|light.');
-- and `text[] || <unknown literal>` is AMBIGUOUS: Postgres may resolve the literal as the
-- ELEMENT (what was meant) or as an ARRAY to concatenate (what it chose here), and then
-- tries to read `REC-1: heavy|light.` as an array literal. Measured from the seat on the
-- main database immediately after that apply:
--
--   ERROR:  malformed array literal: "REC-1: heavy|light."
--
-- So a table with TWO OR MORE problems raised a parser error instead of the list — worse
-- than the one-at-a-time sentence it replaced, because the caller learns nothing at all.
-- A table with ONE problem, and every valid table, were unaffected: both leave the
-- collection empty or reach the single-problem branch, which is why the first four parts
-- of the earlier apply's own verification still ran.
--
-- `array_append` takes an ELEMENT and nothing else, so there is no second reading of it.
-- Every message, every hint, every guard and the one-vs-many rule are otherwise untouched.
--
-- THE CLASS: `||` against an array-typed variable is only unambiguous when the right side
-- is explicitly typed. Both collectors now append, and the hint is cast to text at the
-- append, so neither can be re-read as an array by any future edit.

  -- This guard used to stop at the FIRST thing wrong, so declaring one table meant a
  -- round trip per missing key against the live database. Real-data crew D hit four in a
  -- row (retention_days, default_sort, agent_writable, and a name on each field) declaring
  -- a podcast episode pipeline on 2026-09-21; reproducing it for this fix cost five more
  -- (type, slug, label, display, weight) before the row was even written. A person filling
  -- in a form is told everything that is wrong with it at once, and so is a caller here.
  --
  -- ONE problem still raises the EXACT sentence and hint it always did, byte for byte, so
  -- nothing that asserts on those messages changes. Only TWO OR MORE are combined.
