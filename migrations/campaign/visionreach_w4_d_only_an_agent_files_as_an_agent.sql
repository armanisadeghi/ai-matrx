-- chair-step: replaces two bodies (same signatures, security and grants): custom.work_approval_request refuses `origin = 'agent'` (42501) unless the connection declares the agent tier (platform.declared_actor_tier() = 'agent' — the server's app.actor_tier, or an agent client's x-matrx-actor-tier header on the client channel), and custom.work_approval_decide refuses a decision made from an agent-declared connection (42501). No table, trigger, policy, grant or row is touched. ORDER: apply AFTER visionreach_w4_c_…, and only once the aidream commit that makes matrx_records file its waits inside `declaring(actor)` (origin from the actor) is LIVE on the server — before it, the agent client files undeclared and every agent proposal would be refused.
