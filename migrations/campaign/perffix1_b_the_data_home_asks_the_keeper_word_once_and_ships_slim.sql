-- PERF-FIX-1 (2026-10-07), the data home.
--   * custom.data_home_tables asked the store's keeper-word function (custom.table_kept_for_derived)
--     about every Table once for each place its answer is read - about eleven times a row, 16,910 calls
--     for admin's 1,472 Tables. `offset 0` keeps the planner from pasting the subquery into every
--     reference, so the word is worked out once per Table. Same word, asked once.
--   * custom.data_home_slim: the data home's answer without what the home never needs spelled out. It
--     calls custom.data_home and only re-packs its answer - the very same rows - leaving out a value
--     that is false, or a null maker / maker name / sync source (the reader reads an absent one as false / null), naming each organization
--     once instead of on every Table, and giving who-changed-it as [organization, id, at, who]. It
--     decides nothing, reads nothing, grants nothing. custom.data_home is unchanged.
-- Function bodies and one wrapper: any hour.
