--
-- WHY. DOOR-N-5 (W4-DOOR, 2026-09-18): the read door is "name-keyed by default, id-keyed on
-- request". The page doors (custom.read_records, read_records_matching, read_records_archived)
-- have always renamed EVERY declared Field's key to its id when asked (`all_key_ids`). The
-- single-record door and read_records_by_ids renamed only the HIDDEN Fields' keys: their id map
-- was the one the notices query built, which only ever held the Fields the reader may not see
-- (found by READ-MASK-ONCE). So the same record, asked for by id, came back keyed by name from
-- custom.read_record and by id from custom.read_records — two answers to one question, and a
-- document whose keys changed shape with the reader's rung.
--
-- THE FIX. Both doors rename with `all_key_ids`, the page doors' map. Name-keyed answers (every
-- product caller: the records client, the portal, the grid) do not move. `_hidden`, `_choices`,
-- `_alternates` and `_retired` keep the keys they already had.
--
-- CONSUMERS. No product caller asks custom.read_record by id; custom.read_records_by_ids by id is
-- asked by matrx-frontend features/sharing/service/sharedResourceDetails.ts on the kernel Table
-- (no declared Field anywhere, so nothing is renamed) and by one live test that counts rows. The
-- 87 campaign suites that called custom.read_record(org, id, true) and then read values by NAME
-- were relying on the defect; they now ask for what they read (`false`).
--
-- Inverse: migrations/inverse/storereadperf2_by_id_renames_every_declared_key_down.sql.
