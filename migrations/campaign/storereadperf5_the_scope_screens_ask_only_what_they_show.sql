-- draft: STORE-READ-PERF-5 — held for the owner's production apply (brief 2026-09-30: this lane makes no production change; rehearsed on the clone, see PROGRESS-STORE-READ-PERF-5.md). Remove this line to apply.
-- chair-step: it CREATES two helper functions (custom._record_shown_to_ctx: SECURITY INVOKER, no client EXECUTE; custom.seen_among: SECURITY DEFINER, no client EXECUTE, a server_only door row) and REPLACES the bodies of custom.query_visible_ids, public.get_scope_tree, public.get_user_full_context and custom.context_archived_types. Same signatures and grants; one platform.client_callable_door row is inserted (custom.seen_among) and the reason sentence of custom.context_archived_types' door row is rewritten to say what its body now does; no table, index, policy or user/business data row is touched. Nothing a person sees changes: every answer is the same (proven on the clone for both seats), only faster.

-- STORE-READ-PERF-5 — THE SCOPE SCREENS ASK ONLY WHAT THEY SHOW.
--
-- THE PROBLEM (dev clone clone-20260929, warm, one transaction per call as PostgREST runs one; the
-- validate lane's verdict: the store read switch cannot flip while the store path is 2-3x slower):
--   * custom.context_archived_types paged custom.read_records_archived over EVERY archived Table of
--     the organization, rendering each, to keep the few the context system kept: test@test.com's own
--     workspace (1,313 archived Tables, no archived scope type) 7-30 s to answer [].
--   * every custom.query_visible_ids call worked out platform.shown_to_context('record') — the
--     reader's default list AND teammates in every organization she belongs to — once per
--     transaction, i.e. once per door call: ~100 ms for admin@admin.com (47 organizations), ~30 ms
--     for test@test.com, on every tree / values / items call; no record today reads the teammates.
--   * public.get_scope_tree and public.get_user_full_context (behind custom/scope_readers_read_the_store)
--     asked custom.levels_of about every scope and read only its "s": two thirds of the call was the
--     rung (custom.effective_level) nobody reads.
--
-- THE FIX:
--   1. custom.context_archived_types reads only the archived kernel rows whose stored kept_for is
--      context (none: []), and answers them exactly as the archive door does (the one ladder's
--      predicate at viewer, the one read mask, mask_document / choice_render / whole-value pointers).
--   2. custom._record_shown_to_ctx(orgs, table): the "shown to" context for the rows one list reads —
--      the whole platform.shown_to_context('record') when any such row or organization default says
--      my_team, otherwise the same defaults without the teammates (the only part no row there reads).
--      custom.query_visible_ids passes it instead of the whole context.
--   3. custom.seen_among(person, ids): levels_of's "s" without "l" (same classes, keyed on a superset
--      of levels_of's columns; custom.reaches_directly per class — the ladder's whole viewer answer for
--      a record outside the kernel Table; levels_of itself for kernel rows, duplicates and absent ids).
--      get_scope_tree and get_user_full_context ask it instead of levels_of.
--
-- NOTHING DECIDES DIFFERENTLY: the parity suite scripts/campaign-tests/storereadperf5_green.sql
-- compares every changed door old-vs-new in one snapshot for both seats (and planted divergences go
-- red); the timing suite scripts/campaign-tests/storereadperf5_timing.sql is RED on the bodies before
-- this file and GREEN after. Inverse: migrations/inverse/storereadperf5_the_scope_screens_ask_only_what_they_show_down.sql.

-- STORE-READ-PERF-5 (2026-09-30). THE "SHOWN TO" CONTEXT FOR THE RECORDS ONE LIST IS ABOUT TO READ.
--
-- custom.query_visible_ids passes platform.shown_to_context('record') to platform.shown_to_lists
-- for every row it lists. That context names, for EVERY organization the reader belongs to, the
-- organization's default list ('d') and her teammates there ('t'); it is worked out once per
-- transaction, and every PostgREST request is its own transaction, so every door call paid it:
-- ~100 ms for admin@admin.com (47 organizations; iam.teammate_user_ids ~1.3 ms each) and ~30 ms
-- for test@test.com, on every tree, values and items call.
--
-- platform.shown_to_lists reads the context of the ROW'S organization only, and reads the teammates
-- part ('t') only when the row's list resolves to 'my_team' — the row's own shown_to, or, when it has
-- none, the organization's default. So for the organizations this list reads, and this Table when one
-- is named:
--   * when some live row there says 'my_team', or some such organization's default is 'my_team',
--     the answer IS platform.shown_to_context('record'), whole (so the rare case is byte-identical);
--   * otherwise it is that context without the teammates: {org: {"d": <the same default>}} for each
--     of these organizations the reader is a live member of — the only keys any row here can read.
-- It decides nothing: shown_to_lists answers every row exactly as it would with the whole context.
