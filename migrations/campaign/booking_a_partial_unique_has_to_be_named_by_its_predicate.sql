-- LANE BOOKING — A DEFECT IN THE SHIPPED PUBLIC FORM, FOUND BY WALKING THE BOOKING PATH,
-- AND FIXED HERE BECAUSE A BLOCKER YOU CAN SEE AND FIX IS YOURS.
--
-- **Every form submission that carried an idempotency key died**, with
--
--     42P10: there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
--
-- raised from `custom.form_submit` line 119. The submission had already been written by
-- then, so the caller got an error for an answer that HAD landed — the worst shape a
-- failure can take: the person is told it did not work and is invited to send it again.
--
-- THE CAUSE IS ONE MISSING PREDICATE. `custom.anon_replay`'s unique index is PARTIAL —
--
--     CREATE UNIQUE INDEX anon_replay_organization_id_client_key_idx
--       ON custom.anon_replay (organization_id, client_key) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL
--
-- (every canonical table in this store carries `deleted_at`, and its uniques are written
-- this way so a soft-deleted row does not keep a key reserved forever). An inference
-- clause `ON CONFLICT (organization_id, client_key)` with NO `WHERE` does not match a
-- partial index — Postgres will only infer an index whose predicate the statement also
-- states. So the arbiter was never found and the insert raised instead.
--
-- THE FIX IS TO SAY THE PREDICATE, not to widen the index: dropping the `WHERE` would make
-- a soft-deleted replay row block its own key for good.
--
-- WHY IT WAS NOT SEEN: the FORMS lane proved this door with calls that passed no client
-- key, and with replays that took the EARLIER return (an existing submission is answered
-- before this line is reached). Only a FIRST submission that carries a key reaches it —
-- which is what every real browser sends, and what `custom.booking_confirm` forwards.
--
-- THE CLASS. A partial unique index inferred without its predicate is the same defect
-- wherever it appears. Census of `on conflict` against a partial unique in schema `custom`,
-- taken on the main database on 2026-09-20: this was the only one.
