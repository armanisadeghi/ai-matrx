-- chair-step: lane DRILL-CALLS (program DRILL-FINISH, decisions 13 and 24) — A USAGE RECORD SAYS WHETHER A REQUEST OWNS IT. It REPLACES the server-only view runtime._ai_usage_calls (lane DRILL-LEDGER-RECORDS, registry token ai_usage_executions) with the identical select plus ONE column appended last, has_request boolean (the execution belongs to a chat.user_request row). Every existing column, its type, its comment and the view's grants (none to clients) are kept; nothing that reads the view by column name changes. No table, policy or row of anybody's data is touched.
-- lane: DRILL-CALLS
-- lock: platform
--
-- WHY. The Spend page's "dig here" signals (public.admin_spend_breakdown, the parity oracle) count
-- context per model call, and ten-minute bursts, over the executions THAT HAVE A REQUEST only
-- ("WHERE request_id IS NOT NULL"): an execution with no request (a tool, a scrape, a child run)
-- carries its own meters and no model iteration, so counting it would inflate a conversation's
-- context per call and a burst's cost. The drill door filters by a Dimension's value; there was no
-- column a filter could name for "owned by a request", so the findings of the declared definition
-- ai_usage_executions could not ask the oracle's question. has_request is that column (a Dimension,
-- "Has a request"), and it also names the first part of the ledger-vs-model-call reconciliation
-- (decision 29): the ledger spend that no request owns has, by construction, no model call.
--
-- ORDER: after DRILL-LEDGER-RECORDS' drillledger_the_records_behind_a_usage_number_are_the_ledger.sql
-- (which creates the view); the select below is that file's, verbatim, with has_request appended.
-- INVERSE: migrations/inverse/drillcalls_a_usage_record_says_whether_a_request_owns_it_down.sql
-- Proof: scripts/campaign-tests/drillcalls_green.sql (clone).
