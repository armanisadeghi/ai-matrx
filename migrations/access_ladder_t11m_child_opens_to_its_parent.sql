-- lane: access-ladder T-11 leak fixes, part m: a child opens to whoever can open its parent, and a
-- file in the trash is its owner's alone.
--
-- Law: common-docs/policies/access-ladder.md — "Children inherit their parent": a record that
-- belongs to another record has exactly its parent's access. T-11 gave a child no organization
-- lane of its own but no parent lane either, so a child answered to its owner and its own shares
-- only. That was harmless while the only parents were Private AI chats and Confidential coding
-- sessions owned by the file's owner; it is wrong for an HR record's files (the HR staff the record
-- names must open its letter) and for an Organization record's files (an employee's photo opens to
-- whoever opens the employee). So the parent lane lands here, in both places the kernel lives:
--   iam.has_access_for_base   the parent record joins the walk (same level, same public flag)
--   iam.accessible_entity_ids the parent lane set-wise (parent types present, each asked once)
-- iam.entity_read_expr needs no change: files.files reads the set through its bounded
-- `id in (accessible_entity_ids) and has_access` arm, which the two bodies above now answer.
--
-- Trash (soft-delete law: archive, never delete): files.files read coworkers' trashed files — the
-- policy had no deleted_at condition. `file` joins `document` in platform.trash_is_owner_only, the
-- one rule the kernel, the set-wise twin and the policy generator already ask (RC-A1, Google Drive
-- behaviour): a trashed file opens to its owner only; the owner still lists and restores it
-- through the trash functions, and restore gives every lane back. Part p regenerates the policy.
--
-- Replaces two kernel bodies (declared below) and re-records the kernel fingerprint after the
-- proof recorded at the bottom. No table is locked.

      -- property of the TOKEN (every `organization`-class table has it) and nothing anywhere
      -- let one organization say otherwise. `custom/member_default_visibility` is that
      -- sentence, resolved through the one knob ladder and overridable at the organization
      -- rung: `all_records` (the default, and exactly the behaviour above) or `shared_only`,
      -- where membership alone confers nothing and a member reaches a record by owning it, by
      -- a grant, or by containment carrying one — every other arm of this walk, untouched.
      --
      -- The `v_schema = 'custom'` guard is not a carve-out, it is the COST. This function is
      -- the platform's hot access kernel and runs for every node of every walk; the record
      -- store is the only place the knob has a meaning today, and `v_schema` is already in
      -- hand from the entity_types lookup above, so nothing outside schema `custom` pays a
      -- single extra lookup and nothing outside schema `custom` changes behaviour at all.
      -- The organization admin arms above are deliberately NOT gated: this knob is about what
      -- MEMBERSHIP confers (VIS-19), and who administers an organization is VIS-20's question.
      -- 🚨 LEVEL-FIX (2026-09-19) — AND WHAT MEMBERSHIP CONFERS IS A LEVEL, NOT A CEILING.
      -- VIS-2 gave the organization the word "whether"; this line still hard-coded the word
      -- "how much". Measured live on the main database the day this was written, in a brand-new
      -- organization with two seats and every knob at its shipped default: a plain member who
      -- had been shared one record at VIEWER was answered `editor` by the read door and
      -- rewrote, deleted and re-created the owner's record — and kept writing after the share
      -- was revoked, because this arm never looked at the share or at the knob at all. The two
      -- doors said different things in the same breath: `custom.share_access` reported the
      -- organization default as `iam.member_default_level` (viewer) while this arm admitted
      -- editor.
      --
      -- So the lane asks ONE function, `iam.member_lane_confers`, which is the organization's
      -- own answer to "what does membership alone confer HERE": the `custom/member_default_level`
      -- knob at the organization rung, overridden per Table on the Table record itself, NONE
      -- when the organization has said `shared_only` or the Table carries a `restricted` field —
      -- and NONE when a grant addressed to this person already speaks for this thing, which is
      -- VIS-19 ("roles set a default level; per-thing grants override it") in one line. A grant
      -- is admitted by `public.has_permission_for` above at its own level, so overriding here
      -- never loses a level somebody was actually given; it stops the role default SILENTLY
      -- RAISING one. A `p_required` above what the function returns simply is not admitted
      -- (`<= null` is null, which is not true), so the lane fails closed on an unreadable knob.
      --
      -- EVERYTHING OUTSIDE SCHEMA `custom` IS BYTE-FOR-BYTE UNCHANGED, including the
