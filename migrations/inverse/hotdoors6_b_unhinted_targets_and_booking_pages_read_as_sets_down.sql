-- HOT-DOORS-6 (2026-10-09). iam.has_access_for_many WITH THE ORGANIZATION EACH TARGET LIVES IN, when the
-- caller already holds it (p_orgs, parallel to p_targets; null, shorter, or a null element = not known). It is
-- a HINT, never a filter, exactly like custom.record_org_hint: a target found in its hinted organization is
-- read there (one partition of custom.record instead of sixteen: ~280 ms -> ~10 ms for admin@admin.com's 1,537
-- Tables); a target not found there, or with no hint, is read by id alone as before. A hinted hit counts as
-- the one row carrying that id - the same trust the kernel's own hinted row read (KERNEL-ORG-PRUNE) gives it,
-- true while record ids are unique across organizations (no constraint enforces it; KERNEL.md says so).
-- iam.has_access_for_many is this function with no hints, so the two never drift apart.
--
-- KERNEL-SHADOW (2026-10-07). THE SET FORM OF THE ACCESS KERNEL: one row per distinct non-null
-- target, `allowed` = iam.has_access_for(p_person, p_type, target, p_level) — the same answer,
-- resolved once for the whole set instead of once per target. The rule it implements, lane by lane,
-- is common-docs/systems/platform/access/KERNEL.md. It is SHADOW ONLY until Arman decides the swap:
-- iam.has_access_for_shadow asks both forms and returns the old one.
--
-- WHAT IS SET-BASED. The person is resolved once (organizations, admin seats, store switch,
-- member-lane level per organization and Table). The target rows are read in ONE statement. Grants,
-- record memberships, scope assignments and Library grants are one semi-join each over the set.
-- Every clock clause (a grant's expiry) is the statement's own now().
--
-- WHAT IS NOT, AND GOES TO THE ONE-AT-A-TIME KERNEL (iam.has_access_for, unchanged), so the answer is
-- the kernel's by construction:
--   * every type but `record` (the hot path; other types are a later wave, KERNEL.md § Waves);
--   * the whole call, when the registry no longer says what this body assumes about `record`
--     (a reference gate, an owner-only trash rule, a detail or child pointer, a containment or
--     composition parent, or a class whose "Only me" rows do not open to the organization);
--   * one target, when its id is carried by more than one row, when it sits in a global-readable
--     system organization (those arms read the row column T-13 retires, which this body may not), or
--     when platform.reachability holds a container for it.
-- A Confidential row is answered by custom.confidential_answer itself, exactly as the kernel asks it.
--
-- THE PUBLIC LANE: the kernel asks the row column T-13 retires (= 'public'), which this body may not
-- read. A row published_to_web marks, that no other lane opens, is asked of the kernel (KERNEL-SHADOW h).
-- Known one-way gap, fail-closed: a row the kernel would open ONLY because its row column says public
-- while published_to_web says false (possible only with the T-13 dual-write trigger bypassed) is
-- refused here; the shadow and the sweep report it as a disagreement.
