-- STORE-READ-PERF-2 (2026-09-25). THE RUNG, ONCE PER CLASS, FOR A SET OF RECORDS.
--
-- Answers, for each id, exactly what the one ladder answers about it for this person:
--   l = custom.effective_level(p_user_id, <its organization>, id)   (the rung the mask needs)
--   s = custom.has_visibility(p_user_id, 'record', id, 'viewer')   (the read door's own check)
-- as {"<id>": {"l": <level or null>, "s": <bool>}}.
--
-- WHY IT MAY ASK ONCE PER CLASS. Every input the ladder reads about ONE record is either a
-- column of that record — its organization, its Table, its `visibility`, whether it is live,
-- whether this person created it (`iam.owner_of` reads `created_by`) — or a row somewhere else
-- that NAMES that record by id: a grant (`iam.permissions`), a membership held on it
-- (`iam.memberships`, record or scope), a library grant (`platform.entity_grants`), a closure
-- row (`platform.reachability`), a carrying edge (`custom.carrying_edges_of` arms 1a/1b/2a/2b/4
-- — every arm but the Table the record lives in), or an assignment to a scope
-- (`public._edu_can_read_via_assignment`). Everything else the ladder reads — the organization's
-- lanes and knobs, the Table's own grants and carrying, whether this person is an admin, owns a
-- record in the organization, or holds any grant anywhere — is the same for every record that
-- shares those columns. So two records with the same columns and NO row naming either of them
-- get the same answer at every rung, and the ladder is asked once for the class.
--
-- A record that is NAMED by any such row, a row of the kernel Table (arm 4 of has_visibility
-- reads the Table's contents), a record with no Table, an id that is not a record, and every
-- record while `record` has a registered FK containment parent (custom.visible_set's first stop)
-- is asked on its own, exactly as before. The class memo lives in this one call and nowhere
-- else, so it can never outlive the snapshot it was answered in.
--
-- SCOPES-HANDOFF-BUDGET (2026-09-28). An association that TARGETS the record names it only when it
-- is one of the carrying arms that read it from that side — arm 1a (an active association type
-- whose container is the SOURCE) and arm 2a (an active carrying rule of that role whose container
-- is the SOURCE) — exactly as the source-side test below has always matched arms 1b/2b/4. It used
-- to be ANY live association targeting the record, and every scope a transcript, an agent or a
-- workflow is tagged with carries a `context_tag` edge whose container is the scope itself (the
-- target side), so every scope of a type was walked on its own: 1,166 ladder walks for one type.
-- No other arm of the ladder reads an association that targets the record (visibility_ancestors
-- and addressed_cap read only custom.carrying_edges_of; has_access_for_base reads grants,
-- memberships and platform.reachability, each still a naming row here).
