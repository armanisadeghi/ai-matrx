-- It restores custom.io_comment_write exactly as it stood before that file — writing
-- p_organization_id onto the comment row whatever organization the record lives in, and carrying
-- the dead `if false then` branch — and drops the derivation helper. The repair UPDATE is not
-- undone: it moved 0 rows, and re-mis-filing a comment on purpose is not an inverse of anything.
--
-- chair-step: it replaces a live client-door body and drops a function this lane created.
