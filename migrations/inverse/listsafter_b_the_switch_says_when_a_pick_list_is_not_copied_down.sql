-- chair-step: INVERSE of migrations/campaign/listsafter_b_the_switch_says_when_a_pick_list_is_not_copied.sql (lane LISTS-AFTER-SWITCH). Puts back platform._cutover_seam_readiness exactly as production held it before the file: the Data tables card no longer checks that the pick lists are copied (the press still refuses a switch whose list copies are missing).
