  -- out also keeps this to ONE knob read on a path that now fires on every INSERT into 643

  -- Absent, SQL NULL and JSON null all mean the same thing and are read as the empty set.
  -- A value that is genuinely the wrong SHAPE — a string, a number, an array — is still
  -- refused by name, which is what that refusal was always for.
