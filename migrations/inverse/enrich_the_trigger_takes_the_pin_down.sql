-- 2026-09-20 before this lane ran — the forward file's `-- based-on:` hash is the hash of
-- exactly this text. Nothing else is touched.
--
-- Running this ALONE is safe and complete: the two helper functions the forward body calls
-- keep existing and are simply no longer called. Run it BEFORE
-- `enrich_a_persons_edit_holds_the_cell_down.sql`, which drops them.

  -- MEASURED: a real agent turn wrote twenty records and could not delete ONE of them.
  -- custom.record_delete does `update custom.record set deleted_at = now()`, which fires
  -- this trigger over the UNCHANGED document; the document names no `_actor`, so
  -- custom.actor_word falls back to the connection's declaration ('agent'), and the
  -- forward arm below then refuses because nothing names the person the agent acts for —
  -- and nothing CAN, because a delete carries no document to put `_on_behalf_of` in and
  -- there is no GUC for it. So every agent delete, restore and reparent of a business
  -- record was refused, by a check about authorship, on a statement that authors nothing.
  --
  -- The condition is exactly that: an UPDATE whose `data` is not distinct from the row's
  -- existing `data` asserts no Value, so there is no new authorship to record and the
  -- authorship already stored stays exactly as it was. Every check below still runs, in
