-- THE INVERSE of migrations/campaign/guardperf_a_census_that_dies_on_the_clock_is_not_a_verdict.sql:
-- it puts back the two census bodies exactly as they stood on the main database on
-- 2026-09-20, in which
--
--   * `custom.shared_only_disagreements` evaluated the RLS mirror inside a CORRELATED
--     subquery, once per row, so the whole-database ladder walk behind
--     `iam.accessible_entity_ids` was re-entered for every record and the census never
--     returned (killed at 900 s on the main database), and
--   * `custom.list_door_disagreements` CALLED seven doors per (member, Table) and
--     `custom.read_record` per (member, record) — ~73 s — with no fast set-based form and no
--     `p_exhaustive` argument.
--
-- Run it and `pnpm check:store-doors-decide` stops finishing again. The four-argument form
-- this campaign file added is left in place: dropping it would take the `--exhaustive` census
-- with it, and a census is never deleted.
