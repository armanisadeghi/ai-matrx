-- chair-step: the inverse of gridtails_a_relation_to_a_gone_record_says_so_on_the_grid.sql. It puts custom.read_records_matching back byte for byte as S2-PRIME's filtergroups_a_views_nested_question_is_one_where_clause.sql left it (same signature, so every grant stays) and drops the one internal helper custom.unresolved_sources_of. WHAT IT UNDOES: a relation cell whose target was gone reads "—" on the grid again instead of "The record this pointed at no longer exists". No data is touched.
