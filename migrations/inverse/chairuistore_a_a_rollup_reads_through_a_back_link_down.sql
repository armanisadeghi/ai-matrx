  --
  -- The check above asks whether a worked-out column says HOW. This one asks whether what it
  -- says can ever be answered. VERIFIER-10, on Rincon Plumbing Co's "Truck 1 dispatch
  -- backlog": a "Ticket label" column built from the Add-field panel read `—` on all 100
  -- rows, before a write, after a write to a source column, and after a reload. Its stored
  -- expression was `{"op":"concat","args":[{"const":""}]}` — a formula reading no column at
  -- all. That particular shape is the PANEL's to refuse (only the screen knows it asked a
  -- person which columns and was answered with none; a trivial expression is legitimate here,
  -- because a compute Rule with `target_field_id` can be the thing that fills the column —
  -- `scripts/campaign-tests/w1_rule_apply.sql` declares exactly that pair on purpose). So
  -- that half is closed in `@ai-matrx/records-ui`'s FieldEditor and NOT here.
  --
  -- WHAT IS THE STORE'S TO REFUSE IS THE SIBLING THE SAME CENSUS FOUND, WHICH NO SCREEN CAN
  -- SEE. Measured on the main database, 2026-09-22, over every live formula column:
  --
  --     "Worked out"  expr {"op":"concat","args":[{"field":"title"}]}   -> NOT AN ID
  --     "Shouty"      expr {"node":"field","field":"serial"}            -> NOT AN ID
  --     "Doubled"     expr {"op":"concat","args":[{"field":"3014b868-…"}]} -> NO SUCH FIELD
  --
  -- `custom.rule_eval` refuses each of those BY NAME at evaluation — REC-17, "by id, never by
  -- name" — and `custom.derived_value` catches the refusal, writes a `raise warning` no
  -- person will ever read, and answers null. The column is therefore `—` on every record of
  -- that table forever, and the only place the reason exists is a server log. That is the
  -- same defect as F5 wearing a different hat, and it is exactly what a declaration-time
  -- guard is for: the column is refused when somebody writes it, naming the column and what
  -- is wrong with it, instead of going quiet for the rest of its life.
  --
  -- HERE, RATHER THAN IN A DOOR, BECAUSE EVERY WRITER PASSES THROUGH HERE. field_declare,
  -- field_update's behaviour arm, a table spec's inline fields, an import's new columns and
  -- any direct write to custom.record all fire this trigger; a check in one door would leave
  -- the other four open. Rows already saved are untouched until something writes them again.
  -- HELD OFF BY THE CAMPAIGN'S OWN SWITCH, READ BY NAME. `custom.store_is_open` is the one
  -- reader of `custom/system_enabled` and is what `custom.assert_store_door` above already
  -- obeyed — but it reads the knob through a function call, and an OFF proof that rests on a
  -- lane's word about what a function does is not a proof. So the knob is ALSO read here by
  -- its own name: while the switch resolves false for this organization, this new refusal
  -- does not exist and the path is exactly what it was. The two readings differ in one case
  -- and the OR is what keeps it honest — `custom.store_is_open` also answers true for an
  -- organization born after 2026-09-21 01:30:44+00, which has the store on with no override
  -- row to resolve, and a guard that went quiet for every new organization would be worse
  -- than the defect.
