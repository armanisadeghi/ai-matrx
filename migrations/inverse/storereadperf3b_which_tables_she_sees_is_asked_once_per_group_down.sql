  -- while `custom.read_record` refused her the same row.
  --
  -- What the PER-ROW ladder asks about this Table is one thing, and asking exactly it is what
  -- makes the two doors agree by construction instead of by agreement:
  -- `custom.visibility_ancestors` returns the Table as a TERMINAL ancestor of every row in it,
  -- at `admin`, and `custom.reaches_directly` arm 3 then asks
  -- `iam.has_access_for(user, 'record', <the Table>, required)` about it — ownership, a grant
  -- row, the organization lanes, the platform's own containment closure, and nothing above
  -- them. A whole Table shared through `custom.share_grant` writes the `iam.permissions` row
  -- that admits it, so the case this shortcut exists for is untouched.
  --
  -- The rows it does NOT speak for are the ones whose own `visibility` is below `internal`,
  -- which that edge deliberately does not carry; they fall through to their class below.
  --
  -- THE SAME-ORGANISATION, LIVE-ROW JOIN STAYS. The kernel Tables (`Table`, `Field`, and the
  -- home-record kernel every fixture hangs off) live in the SYSTEM organization, which is
  -- global_readable, so `iam.has_access_for` says yes about them to EVERY signed-in person.
