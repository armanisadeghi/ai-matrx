-- chair-step: the inverse of migrations/campaign/choiceval_two_doors_on_the_one_ladder.sql. It
--   puts back the two bodies as the live catalogue rendered them at 2026-09-20 07:10Z: an
--   approval request that decides through custom.assert_client_may_open at VIEWER (which
--   check:store-doors-decide census 1 names, because that is not one of the six deciders it reads
--   for, and which lets anybody who can read a record file a change against it), and a mute that
--   runs `update custom.record` without ever asking whether the store is open (census 6). Running
--   this restores both findings, which is what it is for.
