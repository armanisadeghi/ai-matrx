-- THE DATA HOME IN ONE CALL (lane DATA-HOME-2, chair ruling 2026-09-29). The page asked three doors —
-- custom.data_home_tables, custom.data_home_items, custom.data_home_changed_by — and each paid the
-- walk of which Tables she may open (custom.tables_seen_once_per_group). This door asks the walk ONCE, for all
-- the person's organizations (or the one named), and then calls those three doors in this same
-- statement: each finds its organizations already answered in the statement memo and does not walk
-- them again. The rows are therefore the three doors' own, unchanged:
--   tables      = custom.data_home_tables(p_organization_id), every column
--   items       = custom.data_home_items(p_organization_id), every column
--   changed_by  = custom.data_home_changed_by(asks) where asks names, per organization, every row
--                 the page shows who-changed-it for: Tables and dashboards, digests, checklists and
--                 boards as 'structure', forms and booking pages as 'form', portals as 'portal'
