  -- ── RED-SUITES-2, 2026-09-21: THE LAST TWO KEYS THIS DOOR WAS TOLD AND THREW AWAY. ──────
  -- MEASURED on the main database through `w1_rel_c12` REL-2 / T7, from the seat
  -- `authenticated`: `custom.field_update(org, field, {"on_target_delete":"restrict"})` returns
  -- the field id, reports success, and the column still says `set_null`. `on_target_delete` and
  -- `relation_target` are BOTH declared on the published contract — `FieldPatch` in
  -- `@ai-matrx/records` `src/field.ts`, where `relation_target` is documented as "re-point the
  -- column. The old edges are withdrawn by the door" — and BOTH are honoured only by the
  -- BEHAVIOUR arm above, which runs only when the same patch also carries `type` / `plain` /
  -- `parity_type`. A person changing only "what happens when the thing this points at is
  -- deleted" sends neither, so the settings arm ran and dropped the key.
  --
  -- This is the SAME CLASS this door has already been fixed for four times, each one written
  -- into the body above: `promoted` / `unique` (SEAT-SUITES), `multi` (FIX-7B-FIELD),
  -- `source` / `review_interval_days` (ENRICH), `compute_on` (TAILS-2). These are the last two
  -- keys of `FieldPatch` the settings arm did not carry. As in every one of those, THE ANSWER
  -- IS TO APPLY IT, and the cases that cannot be applied are refused BY NAME.
