-- PERF-FIX-2 (2026-10-07). THE SET FORM OF custom.reaches_directly: one row per distinct non-null
-- target, `reaches` = custom.reaches_directly(p_user_id, p_type, target, p_required) - that very
-- function, asked for each target, so it is not a second ladder and cannot drift from it.
-- What it shares is the one question that function and the access kernel each ask first about a
-- record: does it have a Confidential anchor (custom.confidential_anchor, twice per record, each a
-- read by id across all sixteen partitions). Here it is read ONCE for every target together. A
-- target that no row of class `record` carries, or that exactly one such row carries whose Table is
-- not Confidential and whose document names no parent, has no anchor - custom.confidential_anchor's
-- own loop stops at that first row - and the statement memo is given the very "none" ('-') that
-- function would leave there (only while the transaction has written nothing, as it does). Every
-- other target is left to the anchor function, as before.
-- KERNEL-SHADOW (2026-10-07): the shadow call at the end; see there.
