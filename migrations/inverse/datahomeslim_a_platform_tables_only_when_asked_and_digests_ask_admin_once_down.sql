-- THE DATA HOME IN ONE CALL (lane DATA-HOME-2, chair ruling 2026-09-29). The page asked three doors —
-- custom.data_home_tables, custom.data_home_items, custom.data_home_changed_by — and each paid the
-- walk of which Tables she may open (custom.tables_seen_once_per_group). This door asks the walk ONCE, for all
-- the person's organizations (or the one named), and then calls those three doors in this same
-- statement: each finds its organizations already answered in the statement memo and does not walk
-- them again. The rows are therefore the three doors' own, unchanged:
--   tables      = custom.data_home_tables(p_organization_id), every column
--   items       = custom.data_home_items(p_organization_id), every column
--   changed_by  = custom.data_home_changed_by(asks) where asks names, per organization, every row
--                 the page shows who-changed-it for: Tables and dashboards, digests, checklists and
--                 boards as 'structure', forms and booking pages as 'form', portals as 'portal'
--                 (outside shares have none), at most 500 ids an ask and 200 asks a call.
-- SEARCHED (lane DATA-HOME-3B, 2026-10-01): p_search narrows those same rows to the ones that match and
-- ranks them (see the campaign file's header); unsearched, nothing below the walk changes.
-- APP TABLES (lane CHAIR-DOORS-2, v6 N-C8, 2026-10-02): a Table the app keeps out of every default
-- list (custom.table_kept_out_of_lists — today the outputs an agent lands, kept_for agent_output) is
-- not among the tables unless p_include_app_tables is true — the page's "Show app tables" switch.
-- It is handed to custom.data_home_tables as is; it narrows, never widens, and searched rows obey it.
