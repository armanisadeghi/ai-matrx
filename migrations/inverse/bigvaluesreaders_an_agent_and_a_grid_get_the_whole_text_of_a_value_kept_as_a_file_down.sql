-- chair-step: the inverse of bigvaluesreaders_an_agent_and_a_grid_get_the_whole_text_of_a_value_kept_as_a_file.sql. It puts the six functions back byte for byte as they stood before it (same signatures, so every grant stays), drops its five internal helpers and removes the knob row custom/agent_context_value_cap_bytes (and, by its foreign key, any organization override). WHAT IT UNDOES: an agent's context from the record store is handed the first 1000 characters of a value kept as a file again, a relation to files is a File record id again, and the grid shows the words with no way to the whole text. No record is touched.
