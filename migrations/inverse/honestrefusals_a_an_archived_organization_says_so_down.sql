  -- door (custom.door_reads_only) and through nothing else: every write door still meets the refusal below.

  -- so it never carries to another door in the statement, and it leaves the marker 'w:pub' that the table
  -- doors read (custom.assert_public_reader_names_a_public_table, asked by custom.assert_may_know_table,
  -- custom.assert_client_may_open, custom.views and custom.read_record right after this wall). Those turn a
  -- Table that is NOT Public back into this very refusal, word for word — so for every other Table of the

  -- is the next line of every door and gives a Public Table's rows at viewer and never above.
