-- chair-step: the inverse of migrations/campaign/docgen_a_template_is_the_tables_wording.sql. It drops the three functions that file created (custom.doc_name_token_pattern, custom.doc_name_tokens, custom.doc_letterhead), deletes their door row and the custom/document_letterhead knob row, and restores the four bodies that file replaced to the exact bytes it was written against. Nothing is deleted, moved or revoked beyond that: no record, no template, no rendered document and no approval row is touched, and an approval already filed under kind doc_template_add becomes one custom.work_approval_decide no longer has an arm for, which is why this file should only be run while none is pending.
