-- dd186_anon_columns_billing — THE SIGNED-OUT COLUMN SURFACE OF THE `billing` SCHEMA
-- (DD-186. SECURITY. db-rules §0/§6d/§9. GRANTS ONLY — no policy is created, altered or dropped.
--  RLS filters ROWS and cannot express a COLUMN at all; the column privilege is the only layer
--  that can, and `iam.apply_rls` issues no GRANT of any kind, so a regeneration cannot undo it.)
--
-- ═══ THE DECISION THIS FILE MAKES ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-- These 6 relations are anon-readable ON PURPOSE: each carries a permissive SELECT policy
-- reaching `anon` — in almost every case the generated `pub_read` (`deleted_at is null and
-- visibility = 'public'`). That ROW decision was made by the DD-173 base-contract campaign and is
-- not touched here. The COLUMN decision had never been made by anyone: every one of them answered
-- `select=*` to the published publishable key over HTTPS, so a table became a publishing decision
-- the moment a column was added to it. DD-182 found exactly this on `public.catalog_entries`
-- (a platform admin's uuid in `updated_by`, served to the internet, while the SAME feature's other
-- public path stripped it on purpose). This file is that finding applied to the rest of the surface.
--
-- WHAT IS REVOKED, and it is a closed list of exact column NAMES — never a name pattern, because a
-- gate that guesses is a gate that gets switched off:
--   who   — created_by, updated_by, deleted_by, changed_by, ratified_by, certified_by,
--           human_verified_by, verdict_by, synced_by, last_checked_by, check_claimed_by,
--           user_id, owner_id, owner_user_id, author_id, organization_id, org_id
--   books — version, metadata, is_system
--   contact/secret — email, contact_email, ip_address, fingerprint, phone, phone_number,
--           token, access_token, refresh_token, api_key, secret, password, password_hash
-- Deliberately NOT revoked: `visibility` and `deleted_at` (the gate's own columns — a row a
-- signed-out visitor can see always reads 'public'/null, so they carry no information, and clients
-- legitimately filter on them, which PostgREST cannot do without the column privilege); and names
-- that only LOOK like the list — `max_tokens`, `token_billed`, `total_tokens_used`, `min_tier`,
-- `emitted_fingerprint` (a content hash), and `content_ir.kind_surface.token`, whose values are
-- 'flashcards' and 'mermaid'.
--
-- THE MECHANISM, and why it is the durable one: each relation's TABLE-level grant is revoked and
-- replaced by a COLUMN-level grant naming exactly what stays. A column added to one of these
-- tables tomorrow is therefore NOT readable by a signed-out visitor — the default flips from
-- published to closed, which is the actual class fix. `pnpm check:anon-column-surface` fails on a
-- difference in either direction.
--
-- NOTHING SIGNED-IN CHANGES: grants are per-role, `authenticated` keeps every privilege it holds.
-- SECURITY DEFINER doors run as their owner and never consult the caller's table privileges.
