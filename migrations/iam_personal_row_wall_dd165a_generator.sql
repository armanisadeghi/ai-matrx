-- iam_personal_row_wall_dd165a_generator — DD-165: A PERSONAL ROW STAYS PERSONAL INSIDE AN
-- ORGANIZATION TABLE. The generator half, plus the check that keeps it there.
--
-- THE DEFECT, MEASURED (V-43 §A, 2026-09-12)
-- ------------------------------------------
-- `note` (workbench.notes) is classed `organization`, so `iam.class_lanes` gives it the
-- platform-admin lane and `iam.apply_rls` emits `platform_admin_all`. Its rows carry a per-row
-- `platform.visibility`, and 137 of them are `personal`:
--
--     platform admin arman26@gmail.com, impersonated, rolled back:
--       universe of OTHER people's visibility='personal' notes .... 137
--       readable by that platform admin ........................... 137
--
-- The class is decided per TOKEN; `visibility='personal'` is decided per ROW, and nothing joined the
-- two. `iam.verify_canonical` had no opinion. `check:staff-door` looks only at private/confidential
-- tokens by design. This is not a note-shaped defect: 179 active tokens are unsuppressed AND carry a
-- typed `platform.visibility` column, and 15,106 rows across 19 of them are marked `personal` today.
--
-- ARMAN, 2026-09-12 (access DECISIONS, verbatim): an admin cannot read a person's private data.
-- Rule 9: union only, never widen.
--
-- THE CHAIR'S RULING THIS FILE IMPLEMENTS
-- ---------------------------------------
-- The class sets the DEFAULT lane set; a row's `visibility` only NARROWS it. On every classed table
-- that carries a `visibility` column, the platform-admin arm excludes rows whose visibility is
-- `personal` — the one value `platform.visibility` marks private (personal < internal < link <
-- public). The owner arm, ordinary sharing, explicit grants and `iam.has_access` are untouched, so
-- the owner and everyone they shared with keep reading exactly what they read before.
-- `iam.class_lanes` is UNCHANGED: the class still decides which lanes exist at all.
--
-- WHAT MOVES, PRECISELY
-- ---------------------
--  1. `platform_admin_all` — its USING becomes `visibility >= 'internal' AND is_platform_admin()`
--     on a table with a typed visibility column. Its WITH CHECK is unchanged: DD-165 is a rule about
--     who may READ a person's private row, not about what an admin may write. `svc_all` is a
--     separate policy, so every server-side job running as `service_role` is untouched.
--  2. the `(select public.is_platform_admin()) or ` prefix — walled in every USING position
--     (std_select for entity/system/restricted/component/ledger, and the USING of std_update /
--     std_delete). Left exactly as it was in every WITH CHECK position.
--  3. the restricted lane's ` or public.is_super_admin()` read arm — walled the same way.
--
-- THE ORGANIZATION ARM ALREADY DOES THIS, and that is deliberate rather than an omission here:
-- DD-136 gave `iam.entity_read_expr`'s org-admin / org-member / global-readable arms
-- `visibility >= 'internal'`, and `iam.has_access_for_base` guards the same lanes identically.
-- Measured before writing this file, so it is a fact and not an assumption.
--
-- THE ONE STAFF ARM THIS FILE DOES NOT WALL, NAMED RATHER THAN HIDDEN
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------
-- `iam.has_access_for_base` admits a super admin to a row whose organization is a `global_readable`
-- SYSTEM org, with no visibility guard, and `iam.entity_read_expr` mirrors that arm. Walling the
-- MIRROR alone would change no access whatsoever — the policy's trailing `iam.has_access(...)` call
-- is the kernel itself — so it would be a wall that only looks like one, which is the thing this
-- program refuses to build. Walling the KERNEL changes `iam.entity_read_kernel_fingerprint()` and
-- forces a re-proof of the whole entity read path, which is not this lane's work. Measured today:
-- 8 personal rows sit in a global_readable system org (browser.site_policy 4, mandate.binding 2,
-- education.learn_doc 1, agent.definition 1) — platform content, not a customer's person. They are
-- reported as DD-165's named residue.
--
-- THIS FILE IS THE GENERATOR ONLY. It rewrites no policy on its own; `iam.apply_rls` has to run.
-- The regeneration is dd165c..f (four batches, per-batch commits, the shape DD-137b12 was forced
-- into by a lock storm and a deadlock), measured by dd165b (BEFORE) and dd165g (AFTER + the gate).
-- Between this file and the batches, `iam.verify_canonical` FAILs `personal_row_wall` on every
-- unwalled token — that is the RED, and it is the point.

  -- 🚨 THE PERSONAL-ROW WALL (DD-165, 2026-09-12). The CLASS decides which lanes a table emits;
  -- a ROW's `visibility` only narrows them. Before this check, `note` (workbench.notes) was classed
  -- `organization`, kept `platform_admin_all`, and 137 of 4,166 rows marked `personal` by the person
  -- who wrote them were readable by any platform admin — measured, V-43 §A. The class regime had no
  -- opinion about it and nothing FAILed. Arman, 2026-09-12: an admin cannot read a person's private
  -- data. So on every classed table that carries a real `platform.visibility` column and still has a
  -- staff lane, each staff arm must be emitted in its WALLED form — `visibility >= 'internal'` AND
  -- the staff predicate — and this check FAILs when one is not.
  --
  -- What it deliberately does NOT assert: the system-org arm
  -- `(organization_id in (select organization_id from iam.system_orgs where global_readable) and
  --  is_super_admin())`, which `iam.entity_read_expr` mirrors from `iam.has_access_for_base`. That
  -- arm can only ever match a row owned by a global_readable SYSTEM organization — platform content,
  -- never a customer's person — and walling the mirror alone would change no access at all while the
  -- kernel's own copy stayed open, i.e. a wall that only LOOKS like one. 8 rows live behind it today
  -- and they are named in the DD-165 report rather than hidden here. It is recognised by the
  -- `system_orgs` reference in the same expression.
