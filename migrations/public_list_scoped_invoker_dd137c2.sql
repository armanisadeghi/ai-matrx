-- public_list_scoped_invoker_dd137c2 — NINE LIST RPCs RUN AS THEIR CALLER, AND THEIR BESPOKE ORG
-- PREDICATES ARE DELETED (DD-137c, step 2; VISIBILITY-BY-CLASS §3.3 chair R2).
--
-- THE RULING THIS EXECUTES, VERBATIM (§3.3)
-- -----------------------------------------
--   "1. The eleven become SECURITY INVOKER.
--    2. Their bespoke org predicates are DELETED, not reconciled — a 'mine / everyone' toggle may
--       only ever narrow what RLS already allows. Per-table disagreement is resolved by the
--       registry default, which is what 'one word, one meaning' means."
--
-- WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, MEASURED
-- ---------------------------------
-- Eleven functions each carried a hand-written answer to "who may see this", and they disagreed:
-- five required `visibility in ('internal','public')`, `wfx_list_scoped` required `internal` only,
-- `seo_rank_target_list_scoped` required no visibility at all, and `crm_inbox_list_scoped` resolved
-- membership from `iam.memberships` while the other eight resolved it from
-- `iam.organization_member`. Because every one of them was `SECURITY DEFINER`, those eleven
-- predicates — not RLS — were the ceiling on what a signed-in person could read.
--
-- There was a second defect hiding inside the first, and it is the one Arman actually complained
-- about. Every `orgs` arm carried `created_by IS DISTINCT FROM v_uid`. So the ORGANIZATION view
-- deliberately EXCLUDED the viewer's own rows: four people in one organization each opened the
-- organization tab and each saw the other three's work but never their own. "Everyone's" that omits
-- you is not everyone's.
--
-- WHAT EACH FUNCTION LOSES, AND WHAT IT KEEPS
-- -------------------------------------------
-- LOST — the org arm's three access clauses: the `my_orgs` membership test (RLS decides membership),
-- the `visibility IN (…)` test (RLS decides visibility), and `created_by IS DISTINCT FROM v_uid`
-- (a bug, not a rule). The `my_orgs` CTE itself is deleted; nothing references it any more.
--
-- KEPT — every clause that NARROWS inside what RLS already allows, because narrowing is what a
-- scope toggle IS: `mine` still means `created_by = me`; `shared` still means "granted to me";
-- `public` still means `visibility = 'public'`; `system` (agx only) still means the builtin corpus;
-- and `p_org_id`, which used to reach the query only through `my_orgs`, is now applied directly to
-- the row's own `organization_id` so "this organization's list" still means this organization.
--
-- 🚨 WHY THIS CANNOT WIDEN ANYTHING, AND WHY IT IS PROVEN ANYWAY. A `SECURITY INVOKER` function
-- reads through the caller's RLS, so its result set is a SUBSET of what the caller could already
-- select from the table by hand — which is what the frontend does everywhere else by architecture.
-- That is an argument, and an argument is not a measurement: the proof block at the end of this
-- file calls all nine, as three real plain members, and asserts for each one that
--   (a) the `orgs` result is a subset of the rows RLS lets that person read directly, and
--   (b) the `mine` result is a subset of the `orgs` result — the toggle only ever narrows.
-- An RPC that cannot be measured (nobody with any rows) is REPORTED, never counted as passing.
--
-- The whole definition of each function is rewritten from `pg_get_functiondef` with exactly three
-- edits applied by an asserted script (a rule that matches zero times or twice is a hard failure,
-- never a silent skip): drop `SECURITY DEFINER`, replace the org arm, delete `my_orgs`. Nothing
-- else moves — not the signature, not a parameter default, not the volatility, not `search_path`,
-- not one line of the filter/sort/paginate machinery below the scope CTE.
--
-- `auth.users` becomes `platform.visible_user_identity` (DD-137c1) in the seven that showed the
-- owner's email: `authenticated` has no SELECT on `auth.users`, so running as the caller would
-- otherwise fail outright with 42501.
--
-- TWO OF THE ELEVEN ARE NOT HERE and are not pretended to be: `edu_library_list_scoped` (its scope
-- is resolved inside `public.edu_library_scope_rows`, which must be converted with it and has no
-- organization scope at all yet) and `mnd_list_scoped` (it calls `mandate._rungs`, a SECURITY
-- DEFINER function `authenticated` cannot execute, so its conversion is a chokepoint-3 change).
-- `pnpm check:list-scope` stays RED at 2 of 11 until they land, which is the point of the guard.

-- PROOF — live, three real plain members, inside this migration's own transaction.
--
-- For every converted RPC and every principal:
--   (a) NO WIDENING — every id the RPC returns on the `orgs` scope is an id that person can select
--       from the base table(s) directly under RLS. This is the promise the conversion makes.
--   (b) ONLY NARROWING — the `mine` scope's own total is never larger than the `orgs` total.
--       (Totals, not id sets: every one of these RPCs caps a page at 200 rows, so on a busy table
--       the two pages are different WINDOWS onto the same corpus and an id-set comparison would
--       report a narrowing as a widening. The RPCs' own `total_count` is the unpaginated size, and
--       it is the only honest way to compare the two scopes. Both scopes are still checked id by id
--       against what RLS allows, which is the promise that actually matters.)
-- A pair that could not be measured (an error, or nobody with a single readable row) is COUNTED and
-- RAISED at the end. "I could not measure it" and "it did not widen" are different sentences.
