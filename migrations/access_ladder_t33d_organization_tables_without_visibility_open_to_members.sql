-- column got no organization-member read arm from iam.entity_read_expr, so coworkers were locked out of
-- rows the kernel admits (rag.kg_clusters: test@test.com iam.has_access = true, SELECT 0 of 108). The law:
-- Organization = every member of the owning organization can open it; what they see is the "Shown to"
-- list filter (a knob), never row security.
--   1. iam.entity_read_expr emits the member arm for such a table (not custom, not a parented component;
--      a child row and a Private/Confidential row class stay closed, as iam.personal_opens_row says).
--   2. iam.accessible_entity_ids' trusted set carries the same lane, so components of such a parent follow.
--   3. Fingerprint re-recorded; the fixture must answer as before. Tables are regenerated one per
--      transaction afterwards (register T-33).

  -- column. On the 371 active tokens that do not, its guard could not be written at all, so
  -- the org-role arm was emitted unguarded and an organization admin read every member''s
  -- rows there (66 users.user_feedback rows and 96 transcripts.studio_runs for one real
  -- admin, measured 2026-09-12). The class answers that question the same way on all 672
  -- tokens, column or no column: a `private` or `confidential` token emits NO
  -- organization-role arm, a `private` token emits no organization-member arm either, and
  -- both close the platform-staff arm — our own staff go through the door too.
  --
  -- coalesce(..., true) is the component/ledger case spelled out: those tokens have NO class
  -- of their own (db-rules §6d-1) and keep exactly the behaviour they have always had; the
  -- parent they resolve through is gated on ITS class.
  -- 🚨 THE ORG-ARM PREFIX IS THE ANCHOR, AND IT IS LOAD-BEARING (DD-137b3a). Every
  -- organization arm this function builds opens with `(organization_id is not null and` —
  -- the generator''s own totality guard, on all four of them. Matching a lane''s INNER text
  -- alone is not enough: `iam.my_orgs()` also lives inside the bounded candidate arm, in the
  -- explicit-grant candidate, so a bare match deleted the whole sharing lane from every
  -- `private` token. The class is a FLOOR (§3.6) — ordinary sharing opens above it per item
  -- and per person, and cancelling that is over-tightening, which db-rules §6 treats as the
  -- same size of bug as a stranger let in.
  -- T-33 fix: the organization-role arm is `organization_id in (select iam.my_admin_orgs())` since
