 *   /marketing/brands/[brandId]               — brand cockpit
 *   /marketing/brands/[brandId]/sites/[siteId]/...   — website property verticals
 *   /marketing/brands/[brandId]/socials/...   — (future) social properties
 *   /marketing/sites                          — flattened all-sites view
 *   /marketing/sites/[siteId]/...             — LEGACY; server-redirects to the
