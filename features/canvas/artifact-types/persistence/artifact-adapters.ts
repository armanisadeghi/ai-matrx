/**
 * Artifact persistence adapters — how an artifact's interactive state is saved.
 *
 * Two strategies (see the registry's `persistenceStrategy`):
 *  - GENERIC: state lives on the artifact itself (canvas_item_state), per viewer.
 *  - CUSTOM: a type with its own domain table (flashcards → user_flashcard_*,
 *    quiz → quiz_sessions, tasks → ctx_tasks) plugs in an adapter that creates +
 *    links the domain record on materialize and reads/writes state there.
 *
 * Wave C ships the interface + GENERIC adapter. Wave D registers custom adapters.
