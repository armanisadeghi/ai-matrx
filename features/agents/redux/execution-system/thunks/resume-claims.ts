/**
 * resume-claims — single-flight guard for /resume, keyed by user_request_id.
 *
 * The server's `continuation_needed` flag is best-effort: when the model
 * issued PARALLEL delegated calls, concurrent POST /tool_results responses
 * can BOTH carry `continuation_needed=true`. Two `resumeInstance` dispatches
 * then race — the `hasAbortController(conversationId)` check inside the thunk
 * passes for both, because the abort controller isn't registered until after
 * `await buildToolInjection(...)`. Two parallel model loops on one
 * conversation produced the 2026-06-09 incident (duplicate cx_message
 * positions, the model re-calling the same tool until the duplicate-call
 * guard errored). The server now takes an atomic run claim and 409s the
 * loser, but there's no reason to even attempt the duplicate.
 *
 * Contract (mirrors matrx-extend's `recentContinueBroadcasts`):
 *   - `claimResume` is called SYNCHRONOUSLY at the top of `resumeInstance`,
 *     before its first `await`. Exactly one claim per user_request_id can be
 *     live at a time.
 *   - A claim clears when the resume stream actually OPENS (the next
 *     legitimate continuation for this request — re-entrancy, §2.4 of
 *     CLIENT_TOOL_SUSPEND_RESUME.md — must be able to claim again).
 *   - Claims age out after a TTL so a resume that never opened (pre-stream
 *     failure that forgot to release, tab backgrounded mid-dispatch) can't
 *     suppress recovery forever.
 *
 * Also owns the bounded retry counter for 409 `resume_conflict` (the
 * suspending run hasn't persisted `status='paused'` yet — a fast tool's
 * result POST can beat that write). Attempts carry across retries of the
 * same user_request so the loop is bounded; they reset when a stream opens.
