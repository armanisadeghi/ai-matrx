# Agent Sets — Roadmap to Full Runtime Delegation

Status of the base system: **structure + builder UI shipped** (see [`AGENT_SETS.md`](./AGENT_SETS.md)). A set is an orchestrator agent + `platform.associations` edges; you can build/arrange/annotate a set, but the orchestrator does **not yet run its members**. This doc is the prioritized path to make it real — written so another developer can pick up any phase cold.

**Mimic what already works.** The runtime target is the industry supervisor/worker pattern: OpenAI Swarm (handoffs), LangGraph (supervisor + state graph), CrewAI (sequential + hierarchical crews), AutoGen (group chat). Don't invent a new orchestration paradigm — implement one of these well. Recommended first: **member-as-tool supervisor** (cheapest to build on our existing agent-run + tool-call machinery).

---

## The load-bearing gap: the server can't read a set

Today **only the frontend** reads set membership (`agent_set_list()` + `assoc_for_sources` via `agentSetsService`). aidream has no way to resolve "orchestrator X → its ordered members + config." **Every runtime phase depends on closing this first.**

- **P0 — server-side set reader (aidream).** A Python query (or a service-role RPC the server calls) against `platform.associations`: given `orchestrator_id`, return the `matrx_set` marker (mode/config) + `member` edges (target agent id, `label` = role title, `position`, `metadata`). Mirror the FE `load()` logic in `agentSetsService.ts`. This is the seam everything hangs off.

---

## Phase 1 — Runtime delegation MVP (member-as-tool supervisor)

Goal: run the orchestrator; it can call its members as tools and weave their outputs into one answer.

- **DB — set run config.** Extend the `matrx_set` marker `metadata` with `mode` (`supervisor` for P1) and a routing hint. No schema change — it's jsonb. Optionally add per-member edge `metadata.handoff` (a one-line instruction) + `metadata.member_version_id` (pin a version for reproducible runs, like shortcuts/apps do — see [`AGENT_VERSIONING.md`](./AGENT_VERSIONING.md)).
- **aidream — member-as-tool.** When a run's agent is an orchestrator (has a `matrx_set` marker), the executor synthesizes one **tool per member** (name = role title/`label`, description = the member's description/gap, input schema = the member's `variable_definitions`). A tool call executes that member agent as a nested run and returns its output. This reuses the existing tool-call + agent-run pipeline (`agent_run` / `agent_run_stage` live in the `chat` schema — see [[project_agent_run_chat_move]]) — **nest member runs as child stages** of the orchestrator run so history + observability come for free.
- **FE — "Run set".** Add a Run entry on the set card + builder header. Launch via the canonical `ConversationInvocation` (see [`conversation-invocation-reference.md`](../conversation-invocation-reference.md)) with a flag/marker telling the server this is an orchestrated run. No new run surface needed for P1 — reuse the agent runner/chat.
- **FE — live member highlight.** Subscribe to the run's stage state (Broadcast or the stream) and light up the active member node on the canvas (the War Room live-watch layer is the reference — [[project_war_room]]). Members already render as nodes; add an "active/running/done" ring per node.

**Done when:** clicking Run on the flashcard set produces one orchestrated answer that visibly delegates to members, with each member's sub-run nested in the run history.

---

## Phase 2 — Pipelines & routing (beyond a flat member list)

Today membership is flat (`orchestrator → member`). Real orchestration needs shape.

- **Relationship kinds.** Add `member → member` edges for pipelines/DAGs (deterministic output→input chaining) and conditional edges. Store the kind in edge `metadata` (`{ kind: 'sequential' | 'parallel' | 'conditional', order, condition }`); keep `role='member'` as the base. Register new roles only if a query needs to filter by them.
- **Set modes.** `sequential` (fixed pipeline, output→input wiring), `parallel` (fan-out/gather), `supervisor` (P1 router). Store on the marker.
- **Input mapping editor (FE).** The inspector already shows each member's `variable_definitions` + output schema (built in the UI pass). Add an editor to map *sources* (orchestrator output field / a prior member's output field / a set-level variable / user input) → this member's variables. Persist in edge `metadata.inputMapping`.
- **Canvas edges become editable.** Let the user draw member→member connections on the React Flow canvas to define a pipeline (React Flow `onConnect`); today edges are read-only (orchestrator→member, `nodesConnectable={false}`).
- **aidream — DAG executor.** Execute members per mode + mapping; topological order for sequential/DAG, gather for parallel.

---

## Phase 3 — Correctness & hardening

- **Dangling members.** If a member agent is deleted/archived, the edge orphans. Confirm `_gc_entity_associations` cleans it, and render a "missing member" node instead of a blank card. (KNOWN: verify the GC trigger fires on `agent.definition` soft-delete.)
- **Shared-member hydration.** A member shared with you (not in your owned list) won't be in the `agentDefinition` slice → cards show the fallback name. Batch-fetch missing member ids on set load (ids come from the edges; fetch via `agx_get_list` filtered or `fetchFullAgent` per id).
- **Cycle prevention.** Define rules for an orchestrator that is itself a member elsewhere, or a member pointing back at its orchestrator. Reject cycles at add time (FE guard + a server check when running).
- **Versioned runs.** Honor `member_version_id` so a set run is reproducible even as member agents evolve.
- **Auth.** `agent_set_list()` is org-gated (`iam.has_access`). Define cross-org shared-set behavior; confirm a run can execute members the caller can access but doesn't own.

---

## Phase 4 — Polish, sharing, analytics

- **Richer list cards.** `agent_set_list()` returns `member_count` only; the list cards show decorative dots. Extend the RPC (or a companion) to return the first N member ids/names/accents so cards show real member avatars.
- **Sharing a set.** Share the orchestrator + ensure members are reachable by the grantee (reuse `features/sharing/`). Define what "sharing a set" grants.
- **Set-level context.** Scopes/variables shared across all members at run time (reuse `features/scopes/` + `features/agent-context/`).
- **Templates / duplicate.** "Save as set template" + clone-a-set (duplicate the orchestrator + re-create edges).
- **Mobile builder.** The canvas is desktop; the Grid view is the mobile builder — make sure add/reorder/inspect all work on the Grid path.
- **Bulk add.** "Add all filtered" / multi-select in the library rail.
- **Analytics.** Per-set run history, per-member success/cost, surfaced on the set detail (ties into `agent_run`).

## Cross-repo apply order (any phase touching the DB or backend)

Same discipline as the rest of the platform: **Supabase MCP `apply_migration` → `pnpm db-types` → aidream `python db/generate.py` → both repos commit.** Most of P1–P2's data changes are jsonb `metadata` shape (no DDL). The real backend work is aidream's executor + the server-side set reader (P0).

## Anchors

- FE service (mirror for the server reader): `features/agents/agent-sets/service/agentSetsService.ts`
- Canvas (member highlight + editable edges): `features/agents/agent-sets/components/SetBuilderCanvasImpl.tsx`
- Inspector (input-mapping editor lives here): `features/agents/agent-sets/components/MemberInspector.tsx`
- Association RPCs + enumeration: `assoc_add/remove/set_targets/for_sources`, `agent_set_list()` (`migrations/agent_sets_list_rpc.sql`)
- Reuse, don't fork: agent run/stream ([`STREAMING_SYSTEM.md`](./STREAMING_SYSTEM.md)), tool calls ([`DURABLE_TOOL_CALLS_CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md`](./DURABLE_TOOL_CALLS_CLIENT_INTEGRATION.md)), invocation ([`AGENT_INVOCATION_LIFECYCLE.md`](./AGENT_INVOCATION_LIFECYCLE.md)), versioning ([`AGENT_VERSIONING.md`](./AGENT_VERSIONING.md)), live-watch ([[project_war_room]]).
